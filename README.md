# Corrective Retrieval-Augmented Generation


This project implements a Contextual Retrieval-Augmented Generation (C-RAG) system using LangChain and LangGraph. The main objective is to enhance text generation by integrating retrieval mechanisms for more contextual and accurate responses.

Features

	•	Contextual Retrieval: The project uses a retrieval module to fetch relevant documents or data from a predefined knowledge base.
	•	Augmented Generation: Enhances text generation by integrating the retrieved context into the output, improving accuracy and relevance.
	•	LangGraph Integration: Leverages LangGraph for managing and optimizing query graphs in a seamless and efficient manner.
	•	LangChain Framework: Utilizes the LangChain library for easy chaining of language models, retrieval, and generation tasks.
